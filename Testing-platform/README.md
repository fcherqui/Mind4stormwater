# Platform to assess the performance of low-cost sensors dedicated to water level monitoring

# Description
The development of new low-cost monitoring system requires extensive testing of potential sensors. Testing means:
- assessing the performance of the sensor: precision, accuracy, range of utilisation,
- assessing the influence of the environment: air relative humidity, temperature for example,
- how to communicate with the sensor, how many raw measures to do for each measure, how long to wait between each raw measures, etc.

We propose below a testing platform and its associated code to assess sensors used for water level monitoring. The whole physical platform is home-made and the system is controlled by an Arduino Uno which is connected to a computer to save all the measurements.
